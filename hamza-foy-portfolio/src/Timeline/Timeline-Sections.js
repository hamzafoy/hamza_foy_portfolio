                My name is Hamza Foy, a junior web designer and developer with a growing list
                of projects and websites to my name. I have gotten to that point in my burgeoning career
                where I need a portfolio site to demonstrate my skillset as well as tell my story
                whether to prospective employer, potential client, or curious reader. Much obliged for gracing
                my web anthology and enjoy!

                In the beginning, there was light on the screen and code written on it.
                First, I learned HTML - that structure rendered in my browser.
                Then, I learned CSS - the rendered code in my browser filled with color and style.

                I began to learn through the Treehouse platform and enrolled in Code Louisville.

            <p>
                As I explored HTML and CSS, in the hopes of designing visually pleasing websites,
                I came to realize that the structure and the style did not interact or move.
                I set out to learn JavaScript and loved the simple syntax and the logic it encouraged.
                I am accepted into Code Louisville and complete my Front End Development cohort.

                I began to learn more about the JavaScript programming language including, but not
                limited to, frameworks such as ExpressJS and libraries including React.
                Although my strength is in the frontend, I take great interest in the backend
                leveraging Node.js and learn about ORMs and SQL-based databases.

                I am systematically pursuing my learning in frontend and backend development.
                I have already developed, from scratch, a number of websites for small businesses in my local community
                and deployed a few apps. I am continuing my education through the Treehouse, Pluralsight, and
