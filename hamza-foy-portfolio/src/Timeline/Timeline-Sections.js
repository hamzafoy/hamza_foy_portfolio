            <p>
                In the beginning, there was light on the screen and code written on it.
                First, I learned HTML - that structure rendered in my browser.
                Then, I learned CSS - the rendered code in my browser filled with color and style.
            </p>
        </section>
    ),
    itemTwo: (
        <section className="timeline-display-two">
            <h1>
                Volume II: It doesn't look like anything to me. . .
            </h1>

            <p>
                As I explored HTML and CSS, in the hopes of designing visually pleasing websites,
                I came to realize that the structure and the style did not interact or move.
                I set out to learn JavaScript and loved the simple syntax and the logic it encouraged.
            </p>
